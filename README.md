<h2>Scope and Scenerio:</h2>
<p>Every year each grade 9 group is required to select 7 subjects for which they will further study from grade 10 onwards. Every year students drop their previously selected subjects for multiple reasons including the wrong combinations taken in grade 9 or the subject workload is simply too hard and/or a lot. The school was unable to host a subject choice evening, and this might solve that problem This project will store the final grade 9 averages in a database thus when the students login the program to select their 7 subjects for Grade 10onwards, the project will recommend subject choices and combinations based from their grade 9 results and as the students begin to select (selecting 1 or 2 subjects), the program will recommend subjects which will go well from said subjects already chosen. The chosen subjects will be stored into a text file only to be accessed by an administrative staff. The scope of the program will only cover the grade 9 group of Parktown High School for Girls.</br>For more information on the planning and idea of the PAT,click the following link below .</br></p>
